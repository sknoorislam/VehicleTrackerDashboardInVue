      <p>
        <strong>Vehicle Tracking Admin Dashboard</strong> is a modern, Vue 3-powered platform designed to empower fleet managers, logistics operators, and transportation companies with <strong>real-time vehicle tracking</strong>, <strong>route monitoring</strong>, and <strong>performance insights</strong> — all through an intuitive and interactive admin interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        We built this application with the goal of simplifying fleet operations by combining:
      </p>
      <ul class="list-unstyled ps-3">
        <li>🔍 <strong>Live Location Tracking</strong> for fast decision-making</li>
        <li>🛣 <strong>Historical Route Visualization</strong> for auditing and safety checks</li>
        <li>📋 <strong>Comprehensive Vehicle Lists</strong> for efficient management</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Whether you're monitoring 5 vehicles or 500, our system ensures clarity, speed, and usability at every level of interaction.
      </p>

      <h4 class="mt-5 mb-3">Why We Built This:</h4>
      <ul class="list-unstyled ps-3">
        <li>✅ To demonstrate a production-ready dashboard using <strong>Vue 3</strong>, <strong>Composition API</strong>, and <strong>state management</strong></li>
        <li>🧩 To offer a clean, modular codebase ideal for integration with real GPS/telematics APIs</li>
        <li>🚀 To provide a scalable foundation for building next-gen fleet management systems</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We hope this dashboard serves as a valuable resource for developers and businesses looking to enhance their vehicle tracking capabilities.
